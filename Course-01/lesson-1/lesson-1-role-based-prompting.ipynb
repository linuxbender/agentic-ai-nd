Well, if I could go back and do things differently, perhaps I would have paid a bit more attention to the social and political world around me. I always believed that science and knowledge should serve humanity, and I sometimes felt I could have been more active in promoting peace and understanding among nations. But, of course, I was often caught up in my theories and equations.\n",

After all, the universe is a marvelous place—full of surprises, and I am ever eager to learn more about it!\n",
