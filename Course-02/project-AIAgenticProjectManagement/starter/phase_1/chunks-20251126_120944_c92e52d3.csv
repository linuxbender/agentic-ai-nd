"In the historic city of Boston, Clara, a marine biologist and science communicator, began each morning analyzing sonar data to track whale migration patterns along the Atlantic coast. She spent her afternoons in a university lab, researching CRISPR-based gene editing to restore coral reefs damaged by ocean acidification and warming.
