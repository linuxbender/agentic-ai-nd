Email Router
1. Introduction
1.1 Business Overview
Our organization handles a high volume of incoming email communications that require timely, accurate responses across multiple departments. Currently, manual email triage and routing creates bottlenecks, delays customer responses, and consumes valuable staff time that could be directed toward higher-value activities.
Team members spend significant portions of their workday sorting through emails, determining appropriate handlers, and forwarding messages—a process that introduces inconsistency in response quality and timing. Subject matter experts often receive misdirected inquiries, while routine questions that could be automated consume unnecessary attention.
The introduction of the Email Router system addresses these operational challenges by implementing AI-powered email analysis and routing. This solution will integrate with our existing email infrastructure to automatically categorize incoming messages, generate responses for routine inquiries, and intelligently route complex communications to the appropriate subject matter experts.
By implementing this system, we aim to reduce response times, ensure consistent communication quality, and free our team members to focus on specialized tasks requiring human expertise rather than email management.
1.2 Problem Statement
Our organization is struggling with inefficient email management processes that negatively impact operational performance and customer satisfaction. The current manual approach to email triage and routing presents several critical challenges:
Significant time delays occur between receipt and response as emails pass through multiple hands before reaching the appropriate subject matter expert.
Staff members across departments spend excessive time sorting, categorizing, and forwarding emails, diverting resources from high-value work requiring specialized expertise.
Inconsistent handling of similar inquiries results in variable response quality and contradictory information being provided to customers and partners.
Important emails may be overlooked in high-volume periods, leading to missed opportunities or unaddressed critical issues.
The organization lacks visibility into email traffic patterns that could inform staffing decisions and process improvements.
Routine, repetitive inquiries that could be automated consume disproportionate staff attention and resources.
Without an automated solution to streamline email classification and routing, these inefficiencies will continue to create operational bottlenecks, increase response times, and potentially damage our reputation for customer service excellence.
1.3 Current Process
The existing email management process in our organization follows a largely manual workflow that involves multiple touchpoints and handoffs:
Incoming emails arrive at general departmental inboxes (e.g., info@company.com, support@company.com) or to specific team members.
Administrative staff or designated team members manually open, read, and make initial assessments of each email to determine its priority and appropriate handler.
For routine inquiries, staff members search for relevant information across various knowledge bases, documentation, or by consulting colleagues before drafting responses.
More complex or specialized inquiries require forwarding to subject matter experts (SMEs), often involving multiple transfers before reaching the appropriate person.
SMEs must review each email, including the chain of previous communications, to understand the context before responding.
Responses are drafted individually, with limited standardization or templates, leading to inconsistent messaging and varying quality.
Follow-up tracking is managed through ad-hoc methods such as flagging emails, creating calendar reminders, or maintaining separate spreadsheets.
Performance metrics and response time data are collected manually, if at all, providing little insight into operational efficiency or areas for improvement.
During peak periods or staff absences, backlogs develop quickly with no automated prioritization system to ensure critical communications receive prompt attention.
Cross-departmental inquiries often bounce between teams with unclear ownership, further delaying resolution and creating customer frustration.
This labor-intensive process creates significant inefficiencies, delays customer communication, and represents a substantial opportunity cost as skilled staff members devote time to email management rather than applying their expertise to core business functions.
1.4 Scope
The Email Router project encompasses the development, deployment, and integration of an AI-powered email management system that will:
Interface with our existing email infrastructure to capture and process all incoming external communications.
Analyze email content using natural language processing to determine intent, urgency, and required expertise.
Automatically generate responses for routine, standard inquiries based on approved organizational knowledge.
Route complex inquiries to appropriate subject matter experts based on content analysis and defined business rules.
Provide a management dashboard for monitoring system performance, workflow bottlenecks, and response metrics.
Include tools for continuous improvement through feedback loops and model training.

The project scope specifically excludes:
Modifications to existing backend email servers
Processing of internal employee-to-employee communications
Integration with CRM systems (planned for future phase)
Mobile application development (web interface only in initial release)
