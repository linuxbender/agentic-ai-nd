Slide 2 – Short & Concise

Title:
From Bernoulli to LLMs: The Evolution of Probability in AI

Body:

Bernoulli: Basic probability

Markov Chains: Next-step depends on current state

PageRank: Ranking webpages probabilistically

n-gram Models: Predict next word from previous words

LLMs: Understand context, generate coherent language

Conclusion:
Each step added context and intelligence, culminating in today’s AI-powered language models.

Slide 3 – Business-Oriented

Title:
From Probability to Business Impact: LLMs in Action

Body:
Large Language Models (LLMs) transform business, but their roots go back centuries:

Bernoulli: Foundations of probability

Markov Chains: Sequential processes modeling

PageRank: Ranking & decision-making

n-gram Models: Pattern recognition in text

LLMs: Automating insights, customer interactions, and decision-making

Bottom Line:
LLMs are not magic — they are the next step in a long chain of innovation driving business transformation.

Slide 4 – Technical / Deep Dive

Title:
From Bernoulli to Transformers: A Technical View

Body:

Bernoulli: Independent events, probability basics

Markov Chains: State-dependent sequences

PageRank: Markov chains on graphs

n-gram Models: Fixed-length Markov approximations in NLP

LLMs: Attention-based, high-dimensional context modeling

Insight:
LLMs are autoregressive like n-grams, but leverage deep architectures to capture long-range dependencies far beyond classical Markov assumptions.
