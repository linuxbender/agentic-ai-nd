# Project Rubric: Multi-Agent Inventory & Sales System

## Overview

Use this project rubric to understand and assess the project criteria. Your submission will be evaluated against these requirements.

---

## 1. Agent Workflow Diagram

### 1.1 System Architecture

**Criteria:**
Illustrate the architecture of the multi-agent system, including agent responsibilities and orchestration.

**Submission Requirements:**
- ✅ The workflow diagram includes all of the agents in the multi-agent system (maximum of five agents as per project constraints)
- ✅ Each agent has explicitly defined responsibilities that do not overlap with other systems
- ✅ The orchestration logic and data flow between agents is clear

### 1.2 Agent-Tool Interactions

**Criteria:**
Illustrate the interactions between agents and their tools, specifying the purpose of each tool.

**Submission Requirements:**
- ✅ The workflow diagram depicts tools associated with specific agents
- ✅ For each tool depicted, its purpose and the specific helper function(s) from the starter code it intends to use is specified in the diagram
- ✅ The diagram shows interactions (e.g., data input/output) between agents and their respective tools

---

## 2. Multi-Agent System Implementation

### 2.1 Agent Architecture

**Criteria:**
Implement the multi-agent system with distinct orchestrator and worker agent roles as per their diagram.

**Submission Requirements:**
- ✅ The implemented multi-agent system architecture (agents, their primary roles) matches the submitted agent workflow diagram
- ✅ The system includes an orchestrator agent that manages task delegation to other agents
- ✅ The system implements distinct worker agents (or clearly separated functionalities within agents) for different tasks such as:
  - Inventory management (e.g., checking stock, assessing reorder needs)
  - Quoting (e.g., generating prices, considering discounts)
  - Sales finalization (e.g., processing orders, updating database)
- ✅ The student selects and utilizes one of the recommended agent orchestration frameworks (**smolagents**, **pydantic-ai**, or **npcsh**) for the implementation

### 2.2 Tool Implementation

**Criteria:**
Implement tools for agents using the provided helper functions, ensuring all required functions are utilized.

**Submission Requirements:**
- ✅ Tools for different agents are defined in the code according to the conventions of the selected agent orchestration framework
- ✅ All of the following helper functions from the starter code are used in at least one tool definition within the implemented system:

| Required Helper Functions |
|---------------------------|
| `create_transaction` |
| `get_all_inventory` |
| `get_stock_level` |
| `get_supplier_delivery_date` |
| `get_cash_balance` |
| `generate_financial_report` |
| `search_quote_history` |

## 3. Evaluation and Reflection

### 3.1 System Evaluation

**Criteria:**
Evaluate the multi-agent system using the provided dataset and document the results.

**Submission Requirements:**
- ✅ The multi-agent system is evaluated using the full set of requests provided in `quote_requests_sample.csv` and the results of the evaluation are submitted in `test_results.csv`
- ✅ The `test_results.csv` file (or equivalent documented output) demonstrates that:
  - At least three requests result in a change to the cash balance
  - At least three quote requests are successfully fulfilled
  - Not all requests from `quote_requests_sample.csv` are fulfilled, with reasons provided or implied for unfulfilled requests (e.g., insufficient stock)

### 3.2 Reflection Report

**Criteria:**
Reflect on the architecture, implementation, and performance evaluation of the multi-agent system.

**Submission Requirements:**

The reflection report:

#### 3.2.1 Architecture Explanation
- ✅ Contains an explanation of the agent workflow diagram, detailing the roles of the agents and the decision-making process that led to the chosen architecture
- 📝 **Note:** The student may refer to their diagram file, but the explanation must be in this text report

#### 3.2.2 Evaluation Discussion
- ✅ Discusses the evaluation results from `test_results.csv`, identifying specific strengths of the implemented system
- 📝 **Note:** The student may refer to their `test_results.csv` file, but the discussion must be in this text report

#### 3.2.3 Improvement Suggestions
- ✅ Includes at least two distinct suggestions for further improvements to the system, based on the identified areas of improvement or new potential features

## 4. Industry Best Practices

### 4.1 Transparent Customer Communications

**Criteria:**
Provide transparent and explainable outputs for customer-facing interactions.

**Submission Requirements:**
- ✅ Outputs generated by the system (e.g., quotes, responses to inquiries) for the "customer" contain all the information directly relevant to the customer's request
- ✅ Outputs provided to the "customer" include a rationale or justification for key decisions or outcomes, where appropriate (e.g., why a quote is priced a certain way if discounts are applied, why an order cannot be fulfilled)
- ✅ Customer-facing outputs do **NOT** reveal:
  - ❌ Sensitive internal company information (e.g., exact profit margins, internal system error messages)
  - ❌ Any personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what's essential for the transaction

### 4.2 Code Quality

**Criteria:**
Write code that is readable, well-commented, and modular.

**Submission Requirements:**
- ✅ Variable and function names in the Python code are descriptive and consistently follow a discernible naming convention (e.g., `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for classes, if applicable)
- ✅ The code consists of comments and docstrings at appropriate places
- ✅ Logic within the code has been broken down sufficiently into individual modules

## 5. Bonus: Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out! 🌟

Consider implementing these advanced features to exceed expectations:

### 5.1 Customer Negotiation Agent
Create a customer agent that uses the customer context from the sample requests to then negotiate with the multi-agent system.

### 5.2 Terminal Animation
Make a terminal animation that builds on top of outputs from various agents in the multi-agent system to show the customer how their request is being processed.

### 5.3 Business Advisor Agent
Add a business advisor agent that analyzes all the transactions being handled by the multi-agent system and proactively recommends changes to the business operations in order to improve its efficiency and revenue.
